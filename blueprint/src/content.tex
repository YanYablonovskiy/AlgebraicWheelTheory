\chapter{Introduction}
Agebraic wheels are structures generalising a commutative semiring, attempting to make sense of  `division' by zero. \par
Loosely speaking, given a semiring $R$ and it's associated monoids, one may extend the semi-ring in a variety of well-known ways. Considering an additive inverse extends a commutative semiring, to a structure with a given name: a commutative ring, and attempting the same succesfully for the multiplicative monoid yields a field. \par
Working backwards, given a set $M$ with two monoids -- one in additive notation and one in multiplicative. The path to obtain a semiring is clear,  a wheel however generalises the semiring by removing the usual distributivity and defines a new unary map $wDiv$.

A Wheel $W$ is an algebraic structure which has two binary operations $(+,*)$, like a ring.
Similarly to a commutative ring, a Wheel is a commutative monoid in both operations. Additionally,
there is a multiplicative unary map $wDiv$  which is an involution, as well as a few idiosyncratic
properties in the interactions of the $+$,$*$ and $wDiv$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Involution: $\forall w \in W, wDiv(wDiv(w)) = w$ 
  \item Multiplicative automophism: $\forall w, v \in W, wDiv(wv) = wDiv(w)wDiv(v)$
  \item Right distributivity rule 1: $\forall w, v, u \in W, (w + v)u + 0u= wu + vu$
  \item Right distributivity rule 2: $\forall w, v, u \in W, (w + 0v)u + 0u= wu + 0v$
  \item Right wDiv distributivity: $\forall w, v, u \in W, (w + uv)wDiv(u) = wDiv(u)+ v+0u$
  \item Division by 0: $\forall w \in W, 0Div(0) + w = 0Div(0)$
  \item Zero squared: $0*0 = 0$
  \item Division rule: $\forall w, v \in W, wDiv(w + 0v) = wDiv(w) +0v$
  \end{enumerate}
