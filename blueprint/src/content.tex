\section{Definition of a Wheel}
Algebraic wheels are structures generalising a commutative semiring, attempting to make sense of  `division' by zero. \par
Loosely speaking, given a semiring $R$ and it's associated monoids, one may extend the semi-ring in a variety of well-known ways. Considering an additive inverse extends a commutative semiring, to a structure with a given name: a commutative ring, and attempting the same succesfully for the multiplicative monoid yields a field. \par
Working backwards, given a set $M$ with two monoids -- one in additive notation and one in multiplicative. The path to obtain a semiring is clear,  a wheel however generalises the semiring by removing the usual distributivity and defines a new unary map $wDiv$.
\begin{definition}[\textbf{Wheel}]
  \label{def:Wheel}
  \lean{Wheel}
  \leanok
A Wheel $W$ is an algebraic structure which has two binary operations $(+,*)$, like a ring.
Similarly to a commutative ring, a Wheel is a commutative monoid in both operations. Additionally,
there is a multiplicative unary map $wDiv$  which is an involution, as well as a few idiosyncratic
properties in the interactions of the $+$,$*$ and $wDiv$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Involution: $\forall w \in W, wDiv(wDiv(w)) = w$ 
  \item Multiplicative automophism: $\forall w, v \in W, wDiv(wv) = wDiv(w)wDiv(v)$
  \item Right distributivity rule 1: $\forall w, v, u \in W, (w + v)u + 0u= wu + vu$
  \item Right distributivity rule 2: $\forall w, v, u \in W, (w + 0v)u + 0u= wu + 0v$
  \item Right wDiv distributivity: $\forall w, v, u \in W, (w + uv)wDiv(u) = wDiv(u)+ v+0u$
  \item Division by 0: $\forall w \in W, 0Div(0) + w = 0Div(0)$
  \item Zero squared: $0*0 = 0$
  \item Division rule: $\forall w, v \in W, wDiv(w + 0v) = wDiv(w) +0v$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Whenever not specified, the notation for the monoids is assumed to be $(+,*)$ with neutral elements $0$ and $1$ respectively.
\subsection{Basic results}
Here we collate some very simple propositions that are straightforward given the Wheel definition. These are designed to be auxillary 
and thus somewhat assorted and perhaps trivial, however mechanisation demands specification of what is typically deemed trivial.\par
Define the notation $\backslash_{a}  := wDiv $ for brevity.
\begin{proposition}[\textbf{Unit preserving}]
\label{prop:wDiv_one}
\lean{Wheel.wdiv_one}
\leanok
Given a Wheel $W$ , then $\backslash_{a} 1 = 1$  where $1$ is the neutral element of the multiplicative commutative monoid.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:zero_mul_add}
\lean{Wheel.zero_mul_add}
\leanok
Given a Wheel $W$ and any two elements $a,b \in W$, then:
\[
0a + 0b = 0ab
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:zero_wdiv_mul}
\lean{Wheel.zero_wdiv_mul}
\leanok
Given a Wheel $W$ and any element $a \in W$, then:
\[
(0 \backslash_{a}  0)a = 0 \backslash_{a}  0
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}[\textbf{Dividing by self}]
\label{prop:wdiv_selfl}
\lean{Wheel.wdiv_self}
\leanok
Given a Wheel $W$ and any element $a \in W$, then:
\[
a\backslash_{a}  a = 1 + 0(a\backslash_{a}  a)
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}[\textbf{Right cancellation}]
\label{prop:wdiv_right_cancell}
\lean{Wheel.wdiv_right_cancel'}
\leanok
Given a Wheel $W$ and any elements $a,b,c \in W$ such that $ac = bc$, then:
\[
a + 0c\backslash_{a} c = b + 0c\backslash_{a} c
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}[\textbf{Monoid Automorphism}]
\label{prop:wDivMonAuto}
\lean{Wheel.toMonoidHom}
\leanok
Given a Wheel $W$ ,  $wDiv$ is a monoid automorphism for $(1,*)$.
\end{proposition}
\subsection{Unital interactions}
This section examines how a Wheel $W$ behaves when an element $x \in W$ happens to be a unit in the multiplicative monoid.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:wdiv_inv_add_div}
  \lean{Wheel.isUnit_add_eq_div_add}
  \leanok
  Given a Wheel $W$, and $x \in W$ a unit in the multiplicative monoid of $W$, then the unit and self Wheel division are 
  related by:
  \begin{equation}
    x^{-1} + 0\backslash_{a}x = \backslash_{a}x + 0x^{-1}
  \end{equation}
  where $x^{-1} \in W$ is the associated two-sided multiplicative inverse of the unit $x$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:isUnit_zero_eq_div_mul_add}
  \lean{Wheel.isUnit_zero_eq_div_mul_add}
  \leanok
  Given a Wheel $W$, and $x \in W$ a unit in the multiplicative monoid of $W$, then zero enjoys the following identity: 
  \begin{equation}
    0\backslash_{a}x + 0\backslash_{a}x^{-1} = 0
  \end{equation}
  where $x^{-1} \in W$ is the associated two-sided multiplicative inverse of the unit $x$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:isUnit_inv_eq_div_add}
  \lean{Wheel.isUnit_inv_eq_div_add}
  \leanok
  Given a Wheel $W$, and $x \in W$ a unit in the multiplicative monoid of $W$, then: 
  \begin{equation}
    x^{-1} = \backslash_{a}x + 0x^{-1}\backslash_{a}x^{-1}
  \end{equation}
  where $x^{-1} \in W$ is the associated two-sided multiplicative inverse of the unit $x$.
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:isUnit_div_eq_inv_add}
  \lean{Wheel.isUnit_div_eq_inv_add}
  \leanok
  Given a Wheel $W$, and $x \in W$ a unit in the multiplicative monoid of $W$, then: 
  \begin{equation}
    \backslash_{a}x = x^{-1} + 0x\backslash_{a}x
  \end{equation}
  where $x^{-1} \in W$ is the associated two-sided multiplicative inverse of the unit $x$.
\end{proposition}
\section{Algebraic sub-structures of a Wheel} 
Given a wheel $W$, certain sub-sets form familiar structures. 
\subsection{Induced semiring}
Consider the subset:
\[
\mathcal{R}_{W} := \{ w \in W | 0*w = 0 \}
\]
then $\mathcal{R}$ turns out to be a commutative unital semiring.
\begin{remark}
 For the purposes of this document, we assume semirings to be unital and commutative by default.
\end{remark}
Firstly,
\begin{definition}[\textbf{$\mathcal{R}_{W}$ is a commutative magma in * and +}]
  \lean{Wheel.instRCommMagma,Wheel.instAddCommMagma}
  \leanok
  Given a wheel $W$, then $\mathcal{R}_{W}$ is a commutative magma in both the wheel operations.
\end{definition}
this is primarily to address the `closure' of the algebraic operations in the sub-set. To achieve a semi-ring,
we further need two commutative monoids: one for each of the wheel operations. Having closure, what is left to prove is
a neutral element and associativity.
\begin{definition}[\textbf{$\mathcal{R}_{W}$ is a commutative monoid in * and +}]
  \lean{Wheel.instRCommMonoid,Wheel.instAddCommMonoid}
  \leanok
  Given a wheel $W$, then $\mathcal{R}_{W}$ is a commutative monoid in both the wheel operations.
\end{definition}
Finally, the interaction between the two monoids must be distributive, and the semiring has been defined:
\begin{definition}[\textbf{$\mathcal{R}_{W}$ is a semiring in * and +}]
  \lean{Wheel.instSemiRing,Wheel.toSemiring,Wheel.instLeftDistrib}
  Given a wheel $W$, then $\mathcal{R}_{W}$ is a semiring in * and +.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Induced commutative group}
In this section, consider the subset of a wheel $W$:
\[
  \mathcal{S}_{W} := \{ w \in W | 0*w = 0 \wedge 0*\backslash_{a}w = 0 \},
\]
note that this is also a subset of $\mathcal{R}_{W}$. Once more, begining with the closure of the binary operation *
inherited from the wheel:
\begin{definition}[\textbf{$\mathcal{S}_{W}$ is a commutative magma in *}]
  \lean{Wheel.instSCommMagma}
  \leanok
  Given a wheel $W$, then $\mathcal{S}_{W}$ is a commutative magma in the * wheel operation.
\end{definition}
Followed by the commutative monoid:
\begin{definition}[\textbf{$\mathcal{S}_{W}$ is a commutative monoid in *}]
  \lean{Wheel.instSCommMonoid}
  \leanok
  Given a wheel $W$, then $\mathcal{R}_{W}$ is a commutative monoid in both the wheel operations.
\end{definition}
And finally, the induced commutative group,
\begin{definition}[\textbf{$\mathcal{S}_{W}$ is a commutative group in *}]
  \lean{Wheel.instCommGroup}
  \leanok
  Given a wheel $W$, then $\mathcal{S}_{W}$ is a commutative group in *.
\end{definition}
