\chapter{Introduction}
Agebraic wheels are structures generalising a commutative semiring, attempting to make sense of  `division' by zero. \par
Loosely speaking, given a semiring $R$ and it's associated monoids, one may extend the semi-ring in a variety of well-known ways. Considering an additive inverse extends a commutative semiring, to a structure with a given name: a commutative ring, and attempting the same succesfully for the multiplicative monoid yields a field. \par
The idea of a wheel, is to extend a commutative semiring by introducing a new unary operation $/$, to then have $a \cdot / b$ agree with $a*b^{-1}$.
