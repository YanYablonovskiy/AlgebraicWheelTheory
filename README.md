This project aims to formalise some results of JESPER CARLSTRÖM[1] on algebraic wheels.

This repository aims to *digitize* various mathematical definitions, theorems, and their proofs. 

Digitization, a.k.a mechanization, involves converting traditional rigourous mathematical content (from sources like textbooks, PDFs, websites, or videos) into a type-checking system based on a computer-implemented *foundations of math framework*, such as set theory or type theory.

In this case the foundational theory is a form of caculus of constructions with inductive types, implemented in the Lean 4 functional programming language.
